1/9 - fieldcentric: imu = hardwareMap.get(IMU.class, "imu"); --> imu = hardwareMap.get(IMU.class, "imu 1");
should be old expansion hub - FIND ONE
    - make sure the mecanums are aligned properly
    - make sure method 2 works
    - ask Patrick/Logan if they want to automate any driving
    - plug in encoders


ENCODER MODES:
    - When using RUN_TO_POSITION, make sure to STOP_AND_RESET_ENCODER for that motor in init
        - this season, will probably only use during auton
    - Wheels are NeveRest 40, arm is 60
    - 40: 1120 ticks/rev
    - 60: 1680 ticks/rev


QUESTIONS:
    - Not running arm to position during teleop, how to use pid to counteract gravity?
    - Any teleop uses for encoders?
    - to clarify, what encoder methods does ctrl alt ftc use when making pid methods?
